# Elementary effects

Morris screening estimates the effect of changing one input at a time along
random trajectories. It is useful when you have many factors and too few model
runs for precise Sobol' indices. With $r$ trajectories and $d$ factors, the
cost is $r(d+1)$ model evaluations; 10–50 trajectories is a common starting range.

## Morris 1991

Morris (1991) *Technometrics* 33(2), 161--174. [paper](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/technometrics/90-00/vol-33-02/v3302161.pdf) · [reference](../bibliography.md#morris1991)

The method constructs $r$ random trajectories through a $p$-level grid on the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^d$. Each trajectory is a sequence of $d + 1$ points where consecutive points differ in exactly one coordinate (the OAT property). At each step, a single factor $x_i$ is perturbed by a fixed step $\Delta$, and the resulting change in output defines the **elementary effect** for that factor at that base point:

$$EE_i = \frac{f(x_1, \ldots, x_i + \Delta, \ldots, x_d) - f(\mathbf{x})}{\Delta}$$

The step size follows Saltelli's convention:

$$\Delta = \frac{p}{2(p - 1)}$$

For $p = 4$ (the default), $\Delta = 2/3$. Base points are drawn from the lower half of the grid so that adding $\Delta$ stays on a grid point.

Each trajectory visits each factor exactly once. With $r$ trajectories, every factor accumulates $r$ elementary effects. Three statistics are computed per factor $i$:

$$\mu_i = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{k=1}^{r} EE_i^{(k)}$$

$$\mu_i^* = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{k=1}^{r} \lvert EE_i^{(k)} \rvert$$

$$\sigma_i = \sqrt{\frac{1}{r - 1} \sum_{k=1}^{r} (EE_i^{(k)} - \mu_i)^2}$$

$\mu_i^*$ was introduced by Campolongo et al. (2007) [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.10.004) · [reference](../bibliography.md#campolongo2007) to fix a cancellation problem with the signed mean $\mu_i$: for non-monotonic factors, positive and negative elementary effects average toward zero even when the factor is influential. $\mu_i^*$ averages the magnitudes of the effects, avoiding that cancellation.

$\sigma_i$ indicates the degree of non-linearity or interaction effects. A factor with high $\mu_i^*$ and low $\sigma_i$ has a strong, approximately linear, additive effect. A factor with high $\sigma_i$ relative to $\mu_i^*$ participates in interactions or has a strongly non-linear effect.

### Sampling

```rust
use salib::samplers::build_morris_trajectories;
use salib::*;

let mut rng = RngState::from_seed([0u8; 32]);

// d=8 factors, r=20 trajectories, p=4 grid levels
let trajectories = build_morris_trajectories(
    8, 20, 4, &mut rng
).unwrap();
// Total cost: 20 * (8 + 1) = 180 model evaluations.
```

Grid levels (`p`) must be even (Saltelli convention). `p = 4` is the standard choice; `p = 8` gives finer resolution at the cost of a denser grid but does not change the number of model evaluations.

### Estimation

```rust
use salib::estimators::estimate_morris_effects;

let effects = estimate_morris_effects(&trajectories, |x| {
    x.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, &xi)| (i + 1) as f64 * xi).sum()
}).unwrap();

println!("{effects}");
// Prints μ, μ*, σ per factor.
```

Example results against the additive-linear test function $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{d} i \cdot x_i$ ($d = 8$, $r = 50$, $p = 4$, seed `[0u8; 32]`):

| Factor | $\mu_i$ | $\mu_i^*$ | $\sigma_i$ | Analytic |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 0      | 1.0000  | 1.0000    | 0.0000     | $\mu = 1$, $\sigma = 0$ |
| 1      | 2.0000  | 2.0000    | 0.0000     | $\mu = 2$, $\sigma = 0$ |
| ...    | ...     | ...       | ...        | ... |
| 7      | 8.0000  | 8.0000    | 0.0000     | $\mu = 8$, $\sigma = 0$ |

For a purely linear function, elementary effects are constant across all trajectories: $EE_i = b_i$ regardless of the base point. The estimator recovers each coefficient exactly (to floating-point precision), and $\sigma_i = 0$. For nonlinear functions, elementary effects can vary with the base point.

The mean absolute effect satisfies $\mu_i^* \geq |\mu_i|$, up to floating-point rounding.

## Grouped Morris

Campolongo et al. (2007) *Env. Mod. Soft.* 22(10), 1509--1518. [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.10.004) · [reference](../bibliography.md#campolongo2007)

When inputs are naturally grouped (all parameters of a subsystem, all coefficients of one physical process), grouped Morris perturbs all factors in a group simultaneously rather than one at a time. Instead of $d + 1$ points per trajectory, there are $n_{\text{groups}} + 1$ points. Each step moves every factor in the selected group by $\Delta$.

The elementary effect for a group $g$ is:

$$EE_g = \frac{f(\mathbf{x}_{\text{after}}) - f(\mathbf{x}_{\text{before}})}{\Delta}$$

where the step perturbs all $|g|$ factors in the group. The same $\mu$, $\mu^*$, $\sigma$ statistics are computed per group.

Total cost: $r \times (n_{\text{groups}} + 1)$ model evaluations. When $n_{\text{groups}} \ll d$, this is substantially cheaper than ungrouped Morris.

### Sampling

```rust
use salib::samplers::build_grouped_morris_trajectories;
use salib::*;

let groups = vec![
    Group { name: "subsystem_A".into(), factor_indices: vec![0, 1] },
    Group { name: "subsystem_B".into(), factor_indices: vec![2, 3] },
];

let mut rng = RngState::from_seed([0u8; 32]);

// d=4 total factors, r=50 trajectories, p=4 levels
let trajectories = build_grouped_morris_trajectories(
    &groups, 4, 50, 4, &mut rng
).unwrap();
// Total cost: 50 * (2 + 1) = 150 evaluations (vs 50 * 5 = 250 ungrouped).
```

### Estimation

```rust
use salib::estimators::estimate_grouped_morris_effects;

let effects = estimate_grouped_morris_effects(
    &trajectories,
    &groups,
    |x| x[0] + x[1] + 3.0 * x[2] + 3.0 * x[3],
).unwrap();

// Per-group statistics
let grouped_mu_star = effects.grouped_mu_star
    .as_ref().unwrap();
let group_names = effects.group_names
    .as_ref().unwrap();
for (name, ms) in group_names.iter().zip(grouped_mu_star) {
    println!("{name}: μ* = {ms:.4}");
}
```

The output `MorrisEffects` contains both per-factor and per-group statistics. Per-factor effects in grouped Morris record the group-level elementary effect for each member factor (individual factor contributions cannot be separated when factors move simultaneously).

With singleton groups (one factor per group), grouped Morris produces the same $\mu^*$ values as ungrouped Morris under the same seed.

Grouped Morris measures the effect of changing a group together. Follow up on important groups with an ungrouped analysis to distinguish their members.

## Interpreting the ($\mu^*$, $\sigma$) plane

| Region | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------|
| High $\mu_i^*$, low $\sigma_i$ | Important factor, approximately linear and additive. |
| High $\mu_i^*$, high $\sigma_i$ | Important factor involved in interactions or with strong non-linearity. |
| Low $\mu_i^*$, low $\sigma_i$ | Small effects in the sampled trajectories; consider further checks before fixing the factor. |
| Low $\mu_i^*$, high $\sigma_i$ | Occasional large effects; inspect the individual trajectories. |

Choose a screening threshold in output units and check that the ranking is
stable across trajectories and seeds. If you fix factors before a later Sobol'
analysis, record their fixed values: the resulting indices describe that
reduced model.
